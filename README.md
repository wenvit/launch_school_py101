This is a github repository created by Wendy Vit for working
through the Launch School's **PY101 - Programming Foundations with Python: Basics**

The lesson1_small_problems folder contains solutions to PY101 Small Problems: Easy 1, Easy 2, and Easy 3. 

The lesson2_small_programs folder contains solutions to the mortgage calculator, rock-paper-scissors, and variable scope problems.

The lesson3_practice_problems folder contains solutions to the Easy 1, 2, and 3; Medium 1; and Hard 1 problems.

This repo was originally multiple repos created beginning in Feb 2025. I reorganized the repos into a better, more streamlined structure for moving forward in Launch School.
